# Quantitative Variable Distribution

The Quantitative Variable Distribution module evaluates the distribution
of quantitative values, like lab results or drug dosages, in the data.
It can also evaluate the distribution of patient counts, like the count
of patients with an inpatient visit. This allows an investigator to
determine if the range of values is within expectations and can be used
in their analysis.
