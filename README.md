The Quantitative Variable Distribution module evaluates the distribution of quantitative values, like lab results or drug dosages, in the data. It can also evaluate the distribution of patient counts, like the count of patients with an inpatient visit. This allows an investigator to determine if the range of values is within expectations and can be used in their analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version of this package like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github('ssdqa/quantvariabledistribution')
